# Matt Bonsall's Frontend Accessment for Stackline

This project is built on [vite-template-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started).

I chose to use Chart.js for the graphing library because it is open source, simple, and easily modifieable. I also chose to use MaterialUI's table library to get the desired sorting functionality out of the box. 

The API endpoint is mocked using [MSW](https://mswjs.io/). This allowed me to fully flesh out the API calls the page would make. I also added a delay to show off the nifty loading states. 

I did use Microsoft Copilot to assist with some of the gruntwork as I think it is a valuable tool.  

The app can be access via [Github Pages](https://mvb0005.github.io/)
